            Gapfill model?
        short-hint : |
            Identify the minimal set of biochemical reactions to add to a draft metabolic model to enable it to produce biomass in a specified media.

    media_id :
        ui-name : |
            Gapfilling Media (defaults to complete media)
        short-hint : |
            Media specifies the set of chemical compounds organism can use for its growth. In this function, the media is used as the growth condition for gapfilling, if gapfilling is performed. If none is specified complete media is used.
        long-hint : |
            Media specifies the set of chemical compounds organism can use for its growth. In this function, the media is used as the growth condition for gapfilling, if gapfilling is performed. If none is specified complete media is used. The “Complete” media is an abstraction of what’s available in our biochemistry database. Every compound that can be transported into the extracellular compartment–or, in other words, for which a transport reaction is available–is used in the complete media. This list is built in real-time, meaning that whenever you run FBA with complete media, the available transporters are parsed from the media database–and is therefore not stored permanently in any media object in the workspace.

description : |

    <p>This tool applies the ModelSEED approach to build a model from a metagenome assembly. 
    If a GFF file of annotations is not supplied, the assembly is binned and annotated with RAST.
    If a GFF file is supplied, the annotations in that file are applied to determine the reactions in the model.
    Gene associations are not included in metagenome models. Instead, wherever possible, reactions are associated with the list
    of species predicted to contain them. Also, reactions include total coverage and total hit count.</p>
