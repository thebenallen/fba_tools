        short-hint : |
            User may add gene knockout information one at a time using “add another gene knockout” button. Gene IDs should be in the same format that appears in your metabolic model (e.g., kb|g.220339.CDS.2927)

    media_id :
        ui-name : |
            Media (defaults to complete media)
        short-hint : |
            Media specifies the set of chemical compounds organism can use for its growth. If none is specified complete media is used.
        long-hint : |
            Media specifies the set of chemical compounds organism can use for its growth. If none is specified complete media is used. The “Complete” media is an abstraction of what’s available in our biochemistry database. Every compound that can be transported into the extracellular compartment–or, in other words, for which a transport reaction is available–is used in the complete media. This list is built in real-time, meaning that whenever you run FBA with complete media, the available transporters are parsed from the media database–and is therefore not stored permanently in any media object in the workspace.
