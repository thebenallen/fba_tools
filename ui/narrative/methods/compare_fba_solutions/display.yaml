    <p>KBase permits the use of flux balance analysis to predict how an organism will behave metabolically in a wide range of growth conditions. With this capability, it quickly becomes important to be able to compare the flux profiles predicted by FBA side-by-side, so as to understand how an organism's behavior changes from one condition to the next, or how the behavior of two different organisms vary with in a single condition. The Compare FBA Solutions method enables this comparison. FBA solutions are compared on three levels: (i) the objective value for each FBA solution is compared; (ii) the flux through each reaction in each FBA solution is compared; and (iii) the uptake and excretion of metabolites in each FBA solution is compared. In this comparison, reaction fluxes are categorized into four possible states: not in model; no flux; forward flux; and reverse flux. Metabolite fluxes are categorized into similar states: not in model; no flux; uptake; and excretion. FBA solutions are compared based on these states, and solutions with similar states are compared based on magnitude of flux.</p>
